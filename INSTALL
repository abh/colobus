* create a database and load the table definition in colobus.sql
* copy ./config.example to ./config and edit as appropriate for your
  site
* edit ./run and change the user and group ids used to something
  appropriate
* edit ./log/run and make sure the logs go where you want
* chmod +t `pwd`
* run ./colobus-archive -a to create the initial databases (may take a while)
* ln -s `pwd` /service/colobus
* wait a minute for svscan to pick up the new service
* test with a newsreader
* run ./colobus-archive -a regularly (like from cron) to keep the 
  overview database up to date. it can also be run from within the
  editor file for your list (and you can restrict it to just updating
  the overview for that group).
