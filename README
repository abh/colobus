colobus is an nntp server, written in perl, that provides access to
mail archives in the ezmlm archive format.

basic installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.

the license (mit-style) can be found in the LICENSE file.

it uses the MLDBM, Storable, and BerkeleyDB perl modules to maintain
the overview and message-id databases, so you'll need to install those
if they aren't already installed.

it implements all of rfc 977 (although it will refuse all 'ihave'
commands, and always returns an empty result for 'newnews' commands).
it also ignores the 'distributions' parameters on the 'newnews' and
'newgroups' commands.

it implements the extended 'list' , 'mode reader', 'mode stream',
'xgtitle', and 'xover' commands from rfc 2980.

(the relevant rfc documents have been included in the distribution,
by the way.)

it supports posting by forwarding the post as an email to the list
addresses, with the envelope sender sent to the from address of the
news posting. it handles cross-posting by posting to each list
seperately. it adds an 'Received:' header that includes the ip address
of the poster, to help track evil-doers.
